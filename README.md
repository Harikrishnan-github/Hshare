Please be informed Hshare wallet is just an Interim Wallet for Hcash Project

Considering there will be a large volume of Hcash transaction and trading activities even before the Hcash mainchain goes live, and we do not wish users to incur an additional fees for their transactions, we have created a matured blockchain token system based on UTXO to facilitates transactions. This will also prove efficient by avoiding the Ethereum network congestion due to large numbers of ICO projects recently. 

In order to make the network more stable, we choose a token system similar to Stratis and incorporated POS to ensure the safety of the network. If you deep further, the Stratis token is also modified based on Blackcoin’s code. Hshare is a token created to serve the function of allowing users to trade the token before the Hcash mainchain comes online, it is simply the temporary token and will be able to swap to the actual Hcash token after the mainchain is online. 

The Hcash mainchain is still being developed by cryptography labs in one of the China’s most prestigious university. We will periodically update you with the progress on this over time.
Thanks for your attention and stay tuned for the further update from Hcash dev team.

Thanks.
